# DSA Hex Human

An implementation of the traditional [Human of Hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) as seen
on [lutanho.net](http://www.lutanho.net/Play/hex.html). Created within the CodeBlocks IDE using C++, this verson of the
game runs within the command line.

It was created as the first assignment for
the [Data Structures and Algorithms unit at WSU](http://handbook.westernsydney.edu.au/hbook/unit.aspx?unit=300103.3).
