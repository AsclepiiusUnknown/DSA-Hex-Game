# DSA Hex Human


It was created as the first assignment for
the [Data Structures and Algorithms unit at WSU](http://handbook.westernsydney.edu.au/hbook/unit.aspx?unit=300103.3).

# DSA Hex Game

A fast-paced turn-based game with several advanced algorithms to verse.

This is a C++ implementation of the traditional [Hex board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) as seen on [lutanho.net](http://www.lutanho.net/Play/hex.html). This was my sibmission for the first assignment in Data Structures & Algorithms at WSU. Although the game itself is simple, it includes pathfinding and game playing algorithms such as A*, Minimax (with alpha-beta pruning), and Monte-Carlo which have vastly different strategies.

## New Algorithms / Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. As with all my projects, I am constantly on the lookout to add to the collection of algorithms, especially if they outperform all the others. If you can get the minimax working more efficiently I would love to learn how. If you know of an algorithm then I'd love to hear from you, and if you want to have a go at improving my work then by all means do so, I'd love to learn how I can do better with performance, design patterns, and more.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
